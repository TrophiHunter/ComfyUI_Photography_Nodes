Photography nodes for Comfyui

By TrophiHunter

I wanted a way to batch add effects to images inside Comfyui so I made these nodes.
Some of the effects should be ordered specifically so they stack and are effecting the image emulating camera effects

I made some workflows to show you the correct order.

To add them look under my name TrophiHunter in the nodes area
